    <h2>Common Food Allergies</h2>
    <p>What are Food Allergies?</p>
    
    <p>When the body's immune system reacts abnormally to something you eat or drink, it's known as a food allergy.
According to Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE), itâ€™s estimated that 15 million Americans have food allergies. 
Children are more likely. Approximately 1 in every 13 children in the United States lives with food allergies.
A food allergy may affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory or cardiovascular systems. Many types 
of foods can be allergens, but certain foods are much more likely than others to trigger an allergic reaction.

      <p>What are the symptoms of food Allergies?</p>
      <p>
        Symptoms of food allergies may range from mild to severe. They may come on suddenly or develop over several hours.

        A person's immune system may react to a small amount of the allergen, so food allergies can be particularly dangerous and life-threatening, especially if breathing is affected. Because food allergies can affect breathing, people with asthma are at an increased risk of a fatal allergic reaction to food.

        Mild symptoms related to a food allergy may include:
        sneezing,
        stuffy or runny nose,
        itchy, watery eyes,
        swelling,
        rash,
        stomach cramps,
        diarrhea,
      </p>
      <p>
        Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis) to food are:

        difficulty breathing, including wheezing
        swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat
        hives (an itchy, blotchy, and raised rash)
        dizziness or faintness
        nausea or vomiting
      </p>
      <p>Common allergies to the following foods:</p>
      <p>Milk, Eggs, Peanuts, Fish, ShellFish, Tree Nuts, Wheat, Soy </p>
    </main>
